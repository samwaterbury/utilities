# utilities
Collection of dotfiles, setup commands, and useful code I frequently use.

### What's in this repository

I use this to back up and keep track of the scripts and commands I use for:

* Migrating between computers
* Doing common tasks
* Procrastinating

This repository is continuously added to and will be perpetually incomplete.
Feel free to drop an issue if you want to roast me for anything.
